# App Types Overview

There are two primary classifications for building CLI apps:

- [Run Once](./run_once.md): An app that is immediately executed and exits upon completion.
- [Run Loop](./run_loop.md): Any other behavior, including continuous execution, hybrid behaviors, event-driven mechanisms, etc.
