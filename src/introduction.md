# AppFac - The CLI App Factory

AppFac is a CLI tool designed to create other CLI apps in Rust. Its primary goal is to cut down the time developers spend on the repetitive boilerplate code and setup, letting them dive straight into the app's core logic.

## How Does AppFac Work?

- **Interactive Prompt**: Start AppFac, and you're guided through an interactive series of questions. This helps the tool understand the kind of CLI app you're aiming to create.

- **Boilerplate Templates**: Based on your responses, AppFac chooses a boilerplate template that matches the requirements. These templates are pre-configured chunks of code set up for various common CLI app scenarios.

- **Code Generation**: With the template selected, AppFac generates a complete Rust project. This includes all the necessary dependencies and a basic file structure.

- **Extensibility**: As Rust continues to evolve, so does AppFac. It's designed to be flexible, allowing for easy updates or additions to its boilerplate templates.

## Key Features

- Predefined boilerplate templates for a wide range of CLI app types.
- An interactive guide to walk you through the app creation process.
- Flexibility for future expansions or updates.
