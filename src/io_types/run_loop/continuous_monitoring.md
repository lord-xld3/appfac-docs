# Continuous Monitoring

Continuous monitoring apps are designed to keep a watchful eye on systems, networks, or applications. They continuously check parameters and alert users or take specific actions when certain conditions are met.

Examples include:

- Network traffic monitoring.
- System resource usage tracking.
- Application health checks.

Outputs are crucial for these tools. They typically include:

- Logs of events and anomalies.
- Alerts sent to administrators or other systems.
- Visual representations or dashboards reflecting the monitored parameters.
