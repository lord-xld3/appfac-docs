# Input Only Apps

Apps that capture or act on user input without producing immediate feedback or visible output.

## Examples

- **Logging Tools**:
  - Take user input and log it to files.
  - Use Rust's logging libraries or frameworks like `log` and `env_logger`.

- **Config Setters**:
  - Accept configurations from the user and set them without further feedback.
  - Can use libraries like `config` to handle configuration formats.
